                    <h2>Item 1: Candlestick Phone</h2>
                    <p>Don&rsquo;t try to light this candlestick! It&rsquo;s actually an upright phone from the early 20th century with a mouthpiece at the top, handheld earpiece hanging off the side, and a rotary dial at the base. Dmitri worked for Pacific Bell for many years and was always interested in facilitating and restoring communication, in old and new ways.</p>
                    <p>This phone now operates on spirit waves; feel free to dial a number and leave a spirit message. Make it irreverent; that&rsquo;s how Dmitri would have done it!</p>

                    <p>Two of Dmitri&rsquo;s cartoon heroes were Fred Flinstone and Gumby.  These two 8&rdquo; tall bobble-top figurines &lsquo;dance&rsquo; when you tap their heads. Fred was the inspiration for his and Tom&rsquo;s historic house moving and home rental company, Rockhead &amp; Quarry LLC, named after the quarry where Fred worked.  Gumby plays a ukulele, one of Dmitri&rsquo;s favorite instruments, while dancing the hula.</p>

                    <h2>Item 4: The Perfect Man</h2>
                    <p>This 12&rdquo; plush &ldquo;Perfect Man&rdquo; doll is dressed in perfect LL Bean and sports a cheesy grin and two thumbs up. He&rsquo;s a funny reminder that often amused Dmitri and Tom.  Press his left palm to hear what makes him so perfect! He spouts stereotypical platitudes like:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mmmmm.  You look so beautiful in the morning.</li>
                        <li>No, you don&rsquo;t look at all fat in that dress. How could anything make you look fat?</li>
                        <li>Aw, can&rsquo;t your mother stay another week?</li>
                        <li>Hello darling, have I told you I loved you lately?</li>
                        <li>Did you have a hard day, honey? Why don&rsquo;t you sit down and let me rub your feet?</li>
                        <li>You&rsquo;re going shopping by yourself? How about if I tag along and carry your bags?</li>
                        <li>Actually, I&rsquo;m not sure which way to go. I&rsquo;ll turn in here and ask directions.</li>
                        <li>I love you.</li>
                        <li>Yes, dear.</li>
                        <li>You&rsquo;ve been on my mind all day. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve bought you these flowers.</li>
                        <li>You know, honey, why don&rsquo;t you just relax and let me make dinner tonight?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Item 5: Lost in Space Robot</h2>
                    <p>Dmitri was a huge fan of the original and Netflix versions of this strangely campy take on the Swiss Family Robinson in outer space. This 10” tall figurine is the robot from the original series, who was known for its catchphrase, “Danger Will Robinson!”  Dmitri liked to collect kitschy memorabilia from this and other TV shows (Gumby, Flintstones, Pee Wee&rsquo;s Playhouse) some of which are here today.</p>

                    <h2>Item 6: Portrait of Dmitri and Tom</h2>
                    <p>This pop art portrait shows Tom and Dmitri from the waist up, arm in arm with the Hudson River Valley and black crows in the background. It was made by Haley Tang, 13 years of age, daughter of Connie Tang, a co-worker of Tom&rsquo;s at Eden Housing.  This portrait was inspired by a photo of Tom and Dmitri standing side by side atop a tower at Mohonk Mountain House in New York. Dmitri is holding his cane and flashing “I love you” in American Sign Language over Tom&rsquo;s right shoulder. Flash this same sign at Tom when you see him!</p>

                    <p>Dmitri loved old audio devices, and collected many of these upright Victrolas over the years. The mascot and mark of the Victrola was a cute dog, like the many furry friends Tom and Dmitri have had. Crank the handle on the right side, lift the needle arm behind the record, place the needle down on the 78 disc and enjoy some oldies but goodies!</p>

                    <p>This wrought iron tool is one of many antique gadgets Dmitri loved to collect. Can you guess what this ingenious tool was used for?  Hint: it was used to “power” an old form of a common kitchen appliance. You&rsquo;re getting colder, try again!</p>

                    <p>Dmitri loved Volkswagens and he and Tom owned many vans and bugs.  This model van looks something like “Eric” the 1966 van they drove across the USA in 1979 when they moved to California.</p>

This was always a prominent sculpture in our entrance way, and even in the front window of our house.</p>

Early on in his tenure, the staff focused a lot on switch-adapting toys to make them easier for children with disabilities to play with. Over the years the office housed a variety of switch-adapted toys like this walking, roaring dinosaur. Press the switch to start him moving!</p>

                    <p>Dmitri was the driving force in funding and building the Ed Roberts Campus, which set a new world standard in universal design, and is a beautiful building to boot. Dmitri not only brought all the stakeholders to the table, he guided them to consensus. He also wrangled numerous transportation organizations, quelled community fears, and raised millions of dollars during the financial crisis! This tactile model of the ERC shows some of the building&rsquo;s beautiful architectural features, including the entrance and Oculus.</p>
