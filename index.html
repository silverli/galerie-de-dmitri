                    <p>Don&rsquo;t try to light this candlestick! It&rsquo;s actually an upright phone from the early 20th century with a mouthpiece at the top, handheld earpiece hanging off the side, and a rotary dial at the base. Dmitri worked for Pacific Bell for many years and was always interested in facilitating and restoring communication, in old and new ways.</p>
                    <p>This phone now operates on spirit waves; feel free to dial a number and leave a spirit message. Make it irreverent; that&rsquo;s how Dmitri would have done it!</p>

                    <p>Two of Dmitri&rsquo;s cartoon heroes were Fred Flinstone and Gumby.  These two 8&rdquo; tall bobble-top figurines &lsquo;dance&rsquo; when you tap their heads. Fred was the inspiration for his and Tom&rsquo;s historic house moving and home rental company, Rockhead &amp; Quarry LLC, named after the quarry where Fred worked.  Gumby plays a ukulele, one of Dmitri&rsquo;s favorite instruments, while dancing the hula.</p>

                    <p>This 12&rdquo; plush &ldquo;Perfect Man&rdquo; doll is dressed in perfect LL Bean and sports a cheesy grin and two thumbs up. He&rsquo;s a funny reminder that often amused Dmitri and Tom. Press his left palm to hear what makes him so perfect! He spouts stereotypical platitudes like:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mmmmm.  You look so beautiful in the morning.</li>
                        <li>No, you don&rsquo;t look at all fat in that dress. How could anything make you look fat?</li>
                        <li>Aw, can&rsquo;t your mother stay another week?</li>
                        <li>Hello darling, have I told you I loved you lately?</li>
                        <li>Did you have a hard day, honey? Why don&rsquo;t you sit down and let me rub your feet?</li>
                        <li>You&rsquo;re going shopping by yourself? How about if I tag along and carry your bags?</li>
                        <li>Actually, I&rsquo;m not sure which way to go. I&rsquo;ll turn in here and ask directions.</li>
                        <li>I love you.</li>
                        <li>Yes, dear.</li>
                        <li>You&rsquo;ve been on my mind all day. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve bought you these flowers.</li>
                        <li>You know, honey, why don&rsquo;t you just relax and let me make dinner tonight?</li>

                    <p>Dmitri was a huge fan of the original and Netflix versions of this strangely campy take on the Swiss Family Robinson in outer space. This 10" tall figurine is the robot from the original series, who was known for its catchphrase, "Danger Will Robinson!"  Dmitri liked to collect kitschy memorabilia from this and other TV shows (Gumby, Flintstones, Pee Wee&rsquo;s Playhouse) some of which are here today.</p>

                    <p>This pop art portrait shows Tom and Dmitri from the waist up, arm in arm with the Hudson River Valley and black crows in the background. It was made by Haley Tang, 13 years of age, daughter of Connie Tang, a co-worker of Tom's at Eden Housing. This portrait was inspired by a photo of Tom and Dmitri standing side by side atop a tower at Mohonk Mountain House in New York. Dmitri is holding his cane and flashing "I love you" in American Sign Language over Tom&rsquo;s right shoulder. Flash this same sign at Tom when you see him!</p>

                    <p>Tom and Dmitri were early members of the Lesbian and Gay Parenting Group. With a growing number of other LGBTQ parents and children, they marched during many Pride Parades in the late '80's and early '90s, carrying this banner.</p>

                    <p>Dmitri worked on Harvey Milk's campaign for SF Supervisor in the summer of 1978. Harvey and Mayor George Moscone were assassinated in November 1978 and when Dan White got off in May 1978 with a light sentence for their murders using his "Twinkie" sugar defence, rioters set fire to police cars near City Hall. Dmitri and Tom worked on the "White Night" defense fund that fall when they arrived in SF, to help cover the costs of litigation for the rioters, some of whom were facing sentences 2-3 times longer than Dan White's sentence.</p>

                    <p>Dmitri loved old audio devices, and collected many of these upright Victrolas over the years. The mascot and mark of the Victrola was a cute dog, like the many furry friends Tom and Dmitri have had. Crank the handle on the right side, lift the needle arm behind the record, place the needle down on the 78 disc and enjoy some oldies but goodies!</p>

                    <p>Dmitri was a consummate chef, but was mostly known as the family baker. That love of baking combined with his love of antique kitchen appliances is shown in this blender, one of many appliances that he collected and lovingly restored (including 15 blenders!). He sometimes gave these restored beauties vibrantly colorful new handpainted coats of paint, including this one's royal blue body. </p>

Dmitri not only brought all the stakeholders to the table, he guided them to consensus. He also wrangled numerous transportation organizations, quelled community fears, and raised millions of dollars during the financial crisis!
